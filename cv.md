## ABOUT ME
Hi, my name is Yauheni. I am from Hrodno, Belarus. I am 34 years old. I study at the faculty of web programming, because I really like it and I see my development in this. I am also very hardworking and diligent, but this was not appreciated in my previous jobs. I'm sure everything will work out!
